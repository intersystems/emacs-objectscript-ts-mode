MAJOR-mode for ObjectScript in EMACs
-----------------------------------------
This is a major-mode for editing .cls files in ObjectScript using treesitter.



---------------- Preliminary -------------------

1. In order to run this major-mode, you will need EMACs with a version greater than 29.1.
   This should come shipped with treesitter but you will need to install that too if it is missing.
   
2. You will need the library files generated by tree-sitter-objectscript. Currently, you cannot run the
   treesit-install-language-grammar function as it does not know the repository for objectscript.
   
       a. You can manually download the repository and create the files following this link:
       http://rdp.iscinternal.com:3000/KernelRuntime/tree-sitter-objectscript
       and follow the instructions listed.
        
       b. After you have the library files you will need to put them in a place that EMACs treesitter can recognize and read them. 
          For me this is in, ~/.emacs/.local/cache/tree-sitter but if you're on Windows or Linux this might differ.
          
3. You will also need the treesitter grammars for python, java, and javascript if you want to write those and have syntax coloring in a .cls file.
   This can be done using the :treesitter-install-langauge-grammar since they are officially in the tree-sitter repo.
   
   
-------------- Install -------------------------


Once you've installed the file it's fairly simple to get it to work.
You just need to put it where all you're major modes are.
On Mac this should be in /Applications/Emacs.app/Content/Resources/lisp/progmodes/
but this can differ on Windows or Linux.

This should be all that you need to run the major-mode. When you open your file you can now run M-x objectscript_udl-ts-mode to open up the major mode.

-------------- Default --------------------------


To make the major-mode the default for .cls files you will need to put these two lines into your init.el file:

 (autoload 'objectscript_udl-ts-mode "/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp/progmodes/objectscript_udl-ts-mode.el.gz" "A major mode for objectscript." t)
 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.cls\\'" . objectscript_udl-ts-mode))

This should trump the mode for Latex files and make this major-mode the default when you run your command.
